## Demo Guide

1. Create a Resource Group under your Azure subscription for your demo.
  
    `az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus`

1. Enable Azure Container Apps in your subscription, run the following command in Azue Cloud Shell to register the required provider (wait until completed):

    `az provider register -n Microsoft.App --wait`
1. Create an Azure Application Insights resource for app monitoring (replace values as desired) runnning the following command from Azure Cloud Shell (Bash)

    ```
    az extension add -n application-insights
    az monitor app-insights component create --app YOURAPPINSIGHTS --location westeurope --resource-group myResourceGroup
    ```
    
    Open the resource in the portal and go to **Configure>Properties**, copy the **Connection String** for later. 
    
    
    
    
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR) to keep your .net container (later build and pushed with GitHub Actions. From Cloud Shell:

    `az acr create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name yourcontainerregistry --sku Basic`

1. Create an Azure Key Vault resource. It will later keep secrets like the Weather API key. From Cloud Shell:

    `az keyvault create --name your-unique-keyvault-name --resource-group myResourceGroup --location EastUS`
    
    Once created, go to the resource, open **Settings>Access Keys** and enable **Admin user**. Copy for later:
   
    - Login server
    - Username
    - Password

1. To Test the Weather API calls in the App, you need to create an account in [Openweathermap](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up) and get an API Key

    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64772417/204014383-2b2000fd-1a28-476b-b9db-02b8c336ae82.png)
    
1. Keep your **Openweathermap** API key as a secret in Azure Key Vault. 
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64772417/204014872-997e06d0-ec6f-4e6b-a1e8-c66c5b6adb4b.png)

1. Create an Azure App Configuration (replacing values) running the following command in Azure Cloud Shell (Bash):

    ```
     appConfigHostname=$(az appconfig create \
    --name YOURAPPCONFIGNAME \
    --location westeurope \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --query endpoint \
    --sku free \
    -o tsv
    )
    echo $appConfigHostname
    ```
    
    **Copy the given endpoint** and replace the one in line 26 of file **src>Program.cs** for the value returned. This lines setup the connection between your container and Azure App Configuration/Key Vault. It will be used to get configuration settings dynamically, using feature flags and getting secrets from key vault using the Service Principal (given as enviroment variables to the app) for authentication.
    
1. In the portal, open the created Azure App Configuration. Go to **Operations>Configuration Explorer** and create the following Key-Value pairs.

    - **Create > Key Vault reference** > key  **Weather:ApiKey** > Point to the previously  created secret (latest version). It references the value kept in Key Vault (safer place for sensitive information). 
    - ** Create > key-value > key  **Refresh:Config** > Value **1** . We will use it as a boolean to control when settings should be refreshed by the app (check the Program.cs lines)
    - **Create > key-value > Key **ApplicationInsights:ConnectionString** > Value **copied from previous steps**. It will be used to authenticate and collect telemetry in Azure. 
    
 1. In the portal, open the created Azure App Configuration. Go to **Operations>Feature Manager** and create the following feature flag, it will let us control the app behaviour without redeploy/restart needed:
 
    - **Create** > flag name **WeatherAPI** > key **.appconfig.featureflag/WeatherAPI** > **Apply**
    
    By default it will be disabled. 
    
    

1. Create a Service Principal that will be used as:
    1. Identity used by the GH Action to deploy/update resources to Resource Group
    1. Identity used by the .NET container to connect to Azure Key Vault and Azure App Configuration
    
    Run following command from Cloud Shell (Bash) to create the Service Principal and copy the JSON output: 
    
    `az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "myApp" --role contributor \
                                --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group} \
                                --sdk-auth`
                                
1. Now give the Service Principal access to Key Vault secrets (weatherapi key) Open the Azure Key Vault, **Access Policies** and Create: 
    - Permissions --> Secret Permissions --> Get 
    - Principal --> look for name or clientid of previously created Service Principal and select it
    - Application --> leave and click **Next**
    - Create
    
1. We also need Data Reader access to the Azure App Configuration. Open it in the Azure Portal, go to **Access Control** and **Add > Role Assignment**. Give the Service Principal **App Configuration Data Reader** role, as the app will use it to gain access to this resource. 
    
1. Next, in order to provide previously recorded sensitive information to the GitHub Action, create the following secrets in the GitHub repository, go to repository **Settings>Secrets>Actions** and **New repository secret** for next items:

    |Secret Name  |Value  | 
    --- | --- | 
    |AZURE_RG| Previously created RG|
    |REGISTRY_LOGIN_SERVER |ACR regitry login, for example, "sample.azurecr.io" |
    |REGISTRY_USERNAME | ACR Username |
    |REGISTRY_PASSWORD | ACR Password |
    |SP_AZURE_TENANT_ID| Azure SP Tenant Id |
    |SP_AZURE_CLIENT_ID| Azure SP Client Id |
    |SP_AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET| Azure SP Secret |
    |AZURE_CREDENTIALS | paste all JSON object returned when creating Azure SP |
  
    >NOTE: this secrets are used by the **ci-build.yaml** to modify/build the dockerized .net 6 website and push it to ACR. **replace tokens** action provide the Service Principal details to the app using environment variables, for the app to access Azure Key Vault and Azure App Configuration. Depending on the architectucture and processes used in other solutions, [Managed Identities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) could have been leveraged.
    
1. In the repository, go to the file in root **makefile** and replace the first line with your own container registry login server.

    ` IMAGE_REG ?= xxxxxxxxxxx.azurecr.io `
    
1. For controlling the deployment flow, create a GitHub Environment (used by the CD workflow). Go to  repository **Settings>Environments** and **New environment**. 
    - Name it **ACA** > Configure environment
    - Add yourselve as Requiered reviewer and **Save protection rules**.
    

1. Execute the **CI Build App** workflow. You may need to enable GH Actions in your forked repo. 

    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64772417/209933174-0e6edc49-b839-4f1e-aa84-085c9c24d3de.png)

   The Pipeline will create a docker image, push it to an Azure ACR and trigger a CD workflow to deploy the dockerfile to an Azure Container App.
   
1. **CD AKA** workflow will get executed. The workflow is designed to create the infrastructure first time execute using Bicep. For consequent deployment it implements blue-green deployment strategy using Azure Container App revisions and GitHub environments to control the switch. 

    >WARNING: if you get a issue like "Error while attempting to retrieve the latest Bicep version" it is a [known issue that is getting fixed for bicep](https://github.com/Azure/bicep/issues/3689), try to redeploy again.
  
1. After the second deployment, the CD workflow will ask for approval before balancing traffic to the new container app revision (something similar to pods in k8s). 

    Review your new revision opening the Azure Container App in the Azure Portal, go to **Revisions>Revision management**, and select the latest revision (with no traffic yet) open and test it.

    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64772417/209976739-8a5f6950-c72f-46db-b893-483a6483c1b0.png)

    Approve the Blue-Green switch in GitHub (approve next CD job) if new revision works fine. 

    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64772417/209976891-14d21c21-9245-455f-8423-8d030a7be311.png)

1. You can enable/disable the weather forecast feature in the webapp using the feature flag defined before in Azure App Configuration.



# .NET - Demo Web Application

This is a simple .NET web app using the new minimal hosting model, and Razor pages. It was created from the `dotnet new webapp` template and modified adding custom APIs, Bootstrap v5, Microsoft Identity and other packages/features.

The app has been designed with cloud native demos & containers in mind, in order to provide a real working application for deployment, something more than "hello-world" but with the minimum of pre-reqs. It is not intended as a complete example of a fully functioning architecture or complex software design.

Typical uses would be deployment to Kubernetes, demos of Docker, CI/CD (build pipelines are provided), deployment to cloud (Azure) monitoring, auto-scaling

The app has several basic pages accessed from the top navigation menu, some of which are only lit up when certain configuration variables are set (see 'Optional Features' below):

- **Info** - Will show system & runtime information, and will also display if the app is running from within a Docker container and Kubernetes.
- **Tools** - Some tools useful in demos, such a forcing CPU load (for autoscale demos), and error/exception pages for use with App Insights or other monitoring tool.
- **Monitoring** - Displays realtime CPU load and memory working set charts, fetched from an REST API and displayed using chart.js
- **Weather** - (Optional) Gets the location of the client page (with HTML5 Geolocation). The resulting location is used to fetch a weather forecast from the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/)
- **User Account** - (Optional) When configured with Azure AD (application client id and secret) user login button will be enabled, and an user-account details page enabled, which calls the Microsoft Graph API

Web app will listen on the usual Kestrel port of 5000, but this can be changed by setting the `ASPNETCORE_URLS` environmental variable or with the `--urls` parameter ([see docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel?view=aspnetcore-6.0)).

# Containers

Public container image is [available on GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/users/benc-uk/packages/container/package/dotnet-demoapp).

Run in a container with:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 ghcr.io/benc-uk/dotnet-demoapp:latest
```

Should you want to build your own container, use `make image` and the above variables to customise the name & tag.

## Kubernetes

The app can easily be deployed to Kubernetes using Helm, see [deploy/kubernetes/readme.md](deploy/kubernetes/readme.md) for details

# GitHub Actions CI/CD

A set of GitHub Actions workflows are included for CI / CD. Automated builds for PRs are run in GitHub hosted runners validating the code (linting and tests) and building dev images. When code is merged into master, then automated deployment to AKS is done using Helm.

[![](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/benc-uk/dotnet-demoapp/CI%20Build%20App)](https://github.com/benc-uk/dotnet-demoapp/actions?query=workflow%3A%22CI+Build+App%22) [![](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/benc-uk/dotnet-demoapp/CD%20Release%20-%20AKS?label=release-kubernetes)](https://github.com/benc-uk/dotnet-demoapp/actions?query=workflow%3A%22CD+Release+-+AKS%22)

# Optional Features

The app will start up and run with zero configuration, however the only features that will be available will be the *Info*, *Tools* & *Monitoring* views. The following optional features can be enabled:

### Application Insights

Enable this by setting `ApplicationInsights__InstrumentationKey`

The app has been instrumented with the Application Insights SDK, it will however need to be configured to point to your App Insights instance/workspace. All requests will be tracked, as well as dependant calls to other APIs, exceptions & errors will also be logged

[This article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/asp-net-core) has more information on monitoring .NET with App Insights

If running locally, and using appsettings.Development.json, this can be configured as follows

```json
"ApplicationInsights": {
  "InstrumentationKey": "<key value here>"
}
```

### Weather Details

Enable this by setting `Weather__ApiKey`

This will require a API key from OpenWeather, you can [sign up for free and get one here](https://openweathermap.org/). The page uses a browser API for geolocation to fetch the user's location.
However, the `geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` browser API will only work when the site is served via HTTPS or from localhost. As a fallback, weather for London, UK will be show if the current position can not be obtained

If running locally, and using appsettings.Development.json, this can be configured as follows

```json
"Weather": {
  "ApiKey": "<key value here>"
}
```

### User Authentication with Azure AD and Microsoft Graph

Enable this feature by setting several 'AzureAd' environmental variables, once enabled, a 'Login' button will be displayed on the main top nav bar.

This uses [Microsoft.Identity.Web](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web) which is a library allowing .NET web apps to use the Microsoft Identity Platform (i.e. Azure AD v2.0 endpoint)

In addition the user account page shows details & photo retrieved from the Microsoft Graph API

You will need to register an app in your Azure AD tenant. [See this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app). Make sure you enable the options

- Enable the app for _"Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts"_
- Add _'Web platform'_ for authentication
- Ensure your Redirect URI ends with `/signin-oidc`
- Enable _"Access Tokens"_ and _"ID Tokens"_ in the authentication settings.
- Add a new client secret, and make a note of it's value

Environmental Variables:

- `AzureAd__ClientId`: You app's client id
- `AzureAd__ClientSecret`: You app's client secret
- `AzureAd__Instance`: Set to `https://login.microsoftonline.com/`
- `AzureAd__TenantId`: Set to `common`

If running locally, and using appsettings.Development.json, this can be configured as follows

```json
"AzureAd": {
  "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
  "ClientId": "<change me>",
  "ClientSecret": "<change me>",
  "TenantId": "common",
}
```

## Running in Azure - Container App

If you want to deploy to an Azure Container App, a Bicep template is provided in the [deploy](deploy/) directory

For a quick deployment, use `make deploy` which will create a resource group, the Azure Container App instance (with supporting resources) and deploy the latest image to it

```bash
make deploy
```

> Note. Azure Container App doesn't currently support HTTP header forwarding, so Azure AD sign-in will not work as it mis-redirects to the wrong URL
